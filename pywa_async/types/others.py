    This class is used to handle paginated results from the WhatsApp API. You can iterate over the results, and also access the next and previous pages of results.

    - When using the ``next()`` or ``previous()`` methods, the results are returned as a new instance of the :class:`Result` class.
    - You can access the cursors using the ``before`` and ``after`` properties and use them later in the :class:`Pagination` object.

    Example:

        >>> from pywa import WhatsApp, types
        >>> wa = WhatsApp(...)
        >>> res = wa.get_blocked_users(pagination=types.Pagination(limit=100))

        >>> if res.has_next:
        ...     next_res = res.next()
        ...
        >>> print(res.all())

    Methods:
        next: Get the next page of results. if there is no next page, it returns empty Result.
        previous: Get the previous page of results. if there is no previous page, it returns empty Result.
        all: Get all results from the current page, previous pages, and next pages.
        empty: Returns an empty Result instance.

    Properties:
        has_next: Check if there is a next page of results.
        has_previous: Check if there is a previous page of results.
        before: Cursor that points to the start of the page of data that has been returned.
        after: Cursor that points to the end of the page of data that has been returned.
