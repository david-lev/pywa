ðŸ“ž Calls
=========

The WhatsApp Business Calling API enables you to initiate and receive calls with users on WhatsApp using voice-over-internet protocol (VoIP).

It provides a way to manage call permissions, initiate calls, and handle call events such as connection, termination, and status updates.

.. note::

    WORK IN PROGRESS: Pywa support for WhatsApp calls is still under development. The API is fully implemented and tested, but no actual calls have been made yet.
